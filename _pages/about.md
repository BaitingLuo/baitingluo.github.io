I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, working under the supervision of [Prof. Abhishek Dubey](https://scopelab.ai/). 
My research interests include decision-making under uncertainty, planning, machine learning, and reinforcement learning, with a focus on applications in autonomous cyber-physical systems. 
I am particularly interested in developing innovative approaches for decision-making in high-dimensional, stochastic, and non-stationary environments, as well as enhancing the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my M.S. in Computer Engineering from Northwestern University, where I worked with [Prof. Qi Zhu](http://zhulab.ece.northwestern.edu/team.html) on securing connected and autonomous vehicles. My master's thesis on Sybil Attack Detection in VANET received the [Northwestern Best MS Computer Engineering Thesis Award](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/news-events/news/articles/2021/2021-ece-annual-awards-winners.html). I completed my B.S. in Computer Engineering with a dual degree in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My research has been published in conferences such as ICLR, AAMAS and ICCPS, 
and I have been honored with awards including the [Vanderbilt C.F. Chen Best Paper Runner-Up Award](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/institute-for-software-integrated-systems-vanderbilt-university_engineering-future-technology-activity-7194334972625784832-R1nS/).

Research
======

My research focuses on developing intelligent decision-making systems for autonomous cyber-physical systems, with a particular emphasis on addressing challenges in complex, uncertain, and dynamic environments. The work spans several interconnected areas:

### Decision Making with High Dimensional Action Space

- Latent Macro Action Planner: Developed for offline reinforcement learning, enabling efficient decision-making in high-dimensional, stochastic environments through learned temporally extended actions.

### Decision Making in Non-Stationary Environments

- Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search: Enables safe exploration and online adaptation to changing dynamics in model-based reinforcement learning tasks.
- NS-Gym Toolkit: Provides standardized evaluation environments for online decision-making algorithms in dynamically changing settings.
  
### Runtime Safety Assurance of Autonomous Vehicles

- Dynamic Simplex framework: Improves performance without compromising safety in autonomous systems through planning with multiple generative models in dynamic environments.
- Advanced sampling techniques: Enhances robustness of autonomous vehicle systems through high-risk scenario generation in AV testing.
- Automated testing framework: Evaluates autonomous vehicles under adversarial conditions in simulations.

### Securing Connected and Autonomous Vehicles

- Hybrid GCN-RNN Model: Developed to detect Sybil attacks in connected vehicle networks.
- Dual Cyber-Physical Blockchain Framework: Created for efficient security in large-scale vehicular networks.
